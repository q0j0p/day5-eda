# Pair programming exercise

Choose a dataset from the [UCI machine learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html) to perform EDA on.  The UCI provides a clearing house for many famous datasets used by researchers.  Choose a sensible dataset, i.e., one with a reasonable number of rows and columns, not one with 10,000 features (columns).  UCI's repository calls observations *# Instances* and features *# Attributes*.

What did you discover during EDA?  What were the key properties of your dataset?  What tools did you use?
